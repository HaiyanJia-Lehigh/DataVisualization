## Practice: Charts with Chartbuilder

What are: 
- time-series data? (sounds like time, with measures of years, days, minutes, centuries)
- ordinal data? (sounds like order, rankings, ratings)
- interval data? (think intervals, space between values evenly split, temperature,

## Checklist for Charts

- Is there a title?
- Are axes drawn so that the allotted space is well used?
- Are the independent variable(s) spaced evenly on the horizontal axis?
- Is the dependent variable axis subdivided with equal intervals?
- Are the axes named with the correct variables?
- Are units in parentheses ( ) after the variable, if applicable?
- Is the type of graph appropriate for the data?
- Are data plotted correctly?
- Is all type horizontal?
- Are colors, textures, or other features used to make the graph easier to read?
- Is color used sparingly -- no more than three hues?
- Is a key or legend used if applicable -- though a label might be better?

## Practice: In Class
## Create Bar Chart in Chartbuilder
**Question: What were the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's undergraduate colleges in 2015?**
- Find the data from Lehigh's [Fall 2016 institutional profile](http://www.lehigh.edu/~oir/profiles/profile_files/LUprofile_2016.pdf).
- Create a spreadsheet in Google docs with two columns: College and 2016 Percent of Undergraduate Enrollment.
- Copy that spreadsheet and create a horizontal bar chart or column bar chart in Chartbuilder that shows the percentage of undergraduate enrollment per college. 
- Check [Anatomy of a Chart](http://www.lamivo.com/tipsheets/anatomy_chart.pdf) to make sure you have the essential elements.

**Steps for uploading through GitHub.com**
<p>1) Review the chart on Lehigh undergraduate enrollment per college. </p>
<p>2) Export as Image (png file -- portable network graphic) or svg file (scalable vector graphic, used for interactivity) 
<p>3) The file will download to local computer. Rename to a single name, no spaces</p>
<p>4) At github.com, upload the file to your name.github.io repository. For 2017: Place on ReadMe.md page with the following codes:</p>

![alt tag] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/projectname/branch/path/to/img.png?raw=true)

![title] (https:/ /name.github.io/title of png.png)

Make sure you **copy image address** and paste it into your ReadMe page.

![My image] (username.github.com/repository/img/imagename.jpg) (without spaces between brackets and parentheses)
